# Exercise 4 – Tutorial 3 
 
 ## Overview 
 This directory includes the code of the Exercise 4, which is taken from the Tutorial 3 in the ICT272 Web Design and Development course. It highlights the organization of objects in the various C# projects through the use of `Product` and `Customer` classes.

 In the context of the present study, the following changes have been made for Week 6 related to the original Exercise 4: 
 - Category Property: Embedded a `category` attribute in the `Product` class in order to sort products. 
 - Total Cost Calculation: Proposed another method, `CalculateTotalCost`, which a part of the `Customer` class, to determine the cost of all the products in the customer’s shopping cart. 
 - Main Method Updates: The `Main` method was modified to arrange the products with the new `category` property, and to present the aggregate price of the shopping list. 
 
 ## How to Run
